            <h1>Client</h1>
            <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
            <p>I searched other sites that went through solving a Rubik's cube and found the images that I thought would be helpful for others to learn it more effectively.</p>
            <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h2>
            <p>We used email and it was perfectly effective, I didn't see any problems. He was very good at responding to requests.</p>
            <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
            <p>Yes, my site looks very close to the wire frame and it works well.</p>
            <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
            <p>I will make sure to just have more direct communitcation with the developers and ensure that they're in more contact with each other.</p>

            <h2>How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?</h2>
            <p>I used email, and sent them the site plan highlighted so they knew what they needed to do for their sections.</p>
            <h2>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?</h2>
            <p>I used email, and she was able to view the site at all times so she could correct anything she saw.</p>
            <h2>How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?</h2>
            <p>I created a github repository and shared the url with the client.</p>
            <h2>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?</h2>
            <p>It was very easy to use and update the site files.</p>

            <h1>Junior Developer</h1>
            <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h2>
            <p>I used email, and the only issue we ran into was a lack of information from the client on how he wanted the child pages to look.</p>
            <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h2>
            <p>I knew for one of them but on the other it wasn't really detailed so I didn't know what I needed to do.</p>
            <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
            <p>I was able to contribute to one but the other was really hindered by the lack of a layout.</p>
            <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?</h2>
            <p>Adding to Github was really easy, no issues.</p>

            <h1>General Experience and Reflections</h1>
            <h2>What was the most challenging part of this project for you? Were you able to overcome it?</h2>
            <p>The most challenging part was making the site plan since I'm not any sort of designer but in the end it turned out really good.</p>
            <h2>What did you enjoy most about this project?</h2>
            <p>I really liked taking the info from a site plan and making a page out of it.</p>
            <h2>What would you do differently if you could do the project again?</h2>
            <p>I would make sure to get the info from the client earlier on.</p>
            <h2>Do you feel more confident in working on real-world projects after this experience? Explain.</h2>
            <p>Yes. I know how important the site plan is and will make sure any client gets one to me as early in the design as possible.</p>
